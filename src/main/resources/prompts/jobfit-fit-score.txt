YOUR TASK: Calculate a precise fit score using the weighted scoring methodology below.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCORING METHODOLOGY (FOLLOW EXACTLY):
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 1: SCORE CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (60 points maximum)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
For EACH requirement in criticalRequirements:

a) Check if candidate has this skill:
   - Search in: technicalSkills, professionalSkills, qualifications
   - Ignore softSkills for critical technical requirements

b) Assign match score:
   - FULL MATCH: Exact skill or directly equivalent → 1.0 point
     Example: Requirement "Python" matches skill "Python" = 1.0

   - PARTIAL MATCH: Related/adjacent skill that partially satisfies → 0.5 points
     Example: Requirement "Python" partially matches "Programming experience" = 0.5
     Example: Requirement "LLM systems" partially matches "AI/ML knowledge" = 0.5

   - NO MATCH: Skill not present or no relevant alternative → 0.0 points
     Example: Requirement "Python" vs candidate has only "Stakeholder engagement" = 0.0

c) Calculate Critical Score:
   Critical Score = (Sum of all match scores / Total critical requirements) × 60

   Example: 5 critical requirements, matches = [1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]
   Critical Score = (2.5 / 5) × 60 = 30 points

d) CHECK FOR HARD CAP:
   Critical Match Percentage = (Sum of match scores / Total critical requirements) × 100

   IF Critical Match < 30%%:
     → HARD CAP = 35 (maximum possible total score)
     → Track reason: "Missing 70%%+ of critical requirements"

   ELSE IF Critical Match < 50%%:
     → HARD CAP = 55 (maximum possible total score)
     → Track reason: "Missing 50%%+ of critical requirements"

   ELSE:
     → No hard cap applied

STEP 2: SCORE IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS (25 points maximum)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Apply same matching logic as Step 1 to importantRequirements.
Search in: technicalSkills, professionalSkills, qualifications, softSkills

Important Score = (Sum of match scores / Total important requirements) × 25

If no important requirements exist, assign 25 points (candidate not penalized).

STEP 3: SCORE SUPPORTING REQUIREMENTS (15 points maximum)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Apply same matching logic to supportingRequirements.
Search in: ALL skill categories including softSkills

Supporting Score = (Sum of match scores / Total supporting requirements) × 15

If no supporting requirements exist, assign 15 points.

STEP 4: CALCULATE FINAL SCORE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Preliminary Score = Critical Score + Important Score + Supporting Score

IF hard cap was triggered in Step 1:
   Final Score = MINIMUM(Preliminary Score, Hard Cap Value)
ELSE:
   Final Score = Preliminary Score

Round to nearest integer (0-100).

WORKED EXAMPLE:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Job Requirements:
- criticalRequirements: ["Python programming", "JavaScript", "5+ years software development", "LLM systems experience"]
- importantRequirements: ["PRINCE2 certification", "Agile methodology"]
- supportingRequirements: ["Communication skills", "Team collaboration"]

Candidate Skills:
- technicalSkills: []
- professionalSkills: ["PRINCE2 Practitioner", "Stakeholder engagement", "Project management"]
- softSkills: ["Communication", "Leadership"]
- qualifications: ["PRINCE2 Practitioner", "BA Business Studies"]

STEP 1: Critical Requirements (4 total)
- "Python programming": NO MATCH → 0.0
- "JavaScript": NO MATCH → 0.0
- "5+ years software development": NO MATCH → 0.0
- "LLM systems experience": NO MATCH → 0.0
Total: 0.0 / 4 = 0%% match
Critical Score = (0/4) × 60 = 0 points
HARD CAP TRIGGERED: 0%% < 30%% → Max score = 35

STEP 2: Important Requirements (2 total)
- "PRINCE2 certification": FULL MATCH (in qualifications) → 1.0
- "Agile methodology": NO MATCH → 0.0
Total: 1.0 / 2 = 50%% match
Important Score = (1/2) × 25 = 12.5 points

STEP 3: Supporting Requirements (2 total)
- "Communication skills": FULL MATCH (in softSkills) → 1.0
- "Team collaboration": PARTIAL MATCH ("Leadership" implies collaboration) → 0.5
Total: 1.5 / 2 = 75%% match
Supporting Score = (1.5/2) × 15 = 11.25 points

STEP 4: Final Calculation
Preliminary Score = 0 + 12.5 + 11.25 = 23.75 ≈ 24
Hard Cap = 35
Final Score = min(24, 35) = 24 points

EXPLANATION WRITING GUIDE (150-200 words):
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Address the candidate directly using "you" (or their name if evident).

Required Structure:

[1] OPENING (1-2 sentences):
    State the score and overall fit level clearly.
    Example: "You scored 24%%, indicating a poor fit for this software engineering role due to missing core technical requirements."

[2] CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS (2-3 sentences):
    - List which critical requirements are MET (if any) with specific evidence
    - List which critical requirements are MISSING and why this matters
    - Be specific with skill names
    Example: "The role requires Python, JavaScript, and LLM systems experience—none of which appear in your background. Without hands-on software development experience, you lack the fundamental technical foundation for this position."

[3] STRENGTHS (1-2 sentences):
    Highlight genuine matches in important/supporting areas
    Example: "Your PRINCE2 certification and strong stakeholder engagement skills do align with the project coordination aspects of the role."

[4] KEY GAPS (1-2 sentences):
    Be direct about what's missing for success
    Example: "However, the 60%% weight on technical skills means these soft skills cannot compensate for the absent programming expertise."

[5] CONCLUSION (1 sentence):
    Provide realistic, actionable guidance
    - Low scores (<40): Suggest skill development or different role types
    - Medium scores (40-69): Suggest upskilling in specific areas
    - High scores (70+): Confirm strong candidacy

TONE REQUIREMENTS:
✓ Professional, honest, specific, evidence-based
✓ Respectful but direct—don't sugar-coat major gaps
✓ Reference actual skills from the candidate's profile
✗ Don't overstate "transferable skills" when fundamentals are missing
✗ Don't use vague phrases like "with some training" without specifics
✗ Don't be artificially encouraging when fit is genuinely poor

GRAMMAR & STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
• All sentences must be complete and grammatically correct.
• Do not use run-on sentences.
• Avoid parentheses inside sentences; express ideas in full sentences instead.
• Do not break sentences across multiple lines.
• Use clear connectors such as “However”, “In addition”, “Furthermore”, “As a result”.
• Do not start sentences with vague adverbs like “Also”, “Additionally” unless necessary.
• Every sentence must have a clear subject and verb.
• Avoid filler phrases such as “which may limit your ability” or “solid experience”.
• Avoid vague claims such as “strong communication skills” unless explicitly supported by the candidate’s skills.
• Ensure pronouns refer clearly to the correct subject (avoid ambiguity).
• Avoid disjointed clauses — rewrite them into two clear sentences instead of one long one.
• Do not interrupt sentences with clarifications; rewrite them as separate sentences.
• The final paragraph must read smoothly with no abrupt transitions.
